! Fix code with undefined base class in N13.define()
- Write about auto unbind from events
- Think about auto unbind from any object in class instance. We should check, if this class an instance of Observer mixin
- Add unit tests for all base classes
- Add base collection. It should solve model dependency issue and, maybe parameters issue (see OmniRetail base collection)
- Add nested controller for PlaylistContainer
- Fix cache property
- Add difference between business events and DOM events
- findView() query argument is very long. I should think about decrease of it. For example, it should try to find specified
  view by alias in nested views too.
- Write about global configuration
- Add list of base classes, we need to download before write the code
- Describe configurations for view, controller mixins in child classes
- Add configuration apply from mixins
- Describe order of controller.Controller and controller.View mixins. Controller must be the first!
